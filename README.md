# hello-world
My name is Merissa Muery.
By trade, I'm a lawyer, a writer and an author. 
I've recently become interested in the world of information technology, especially the programming side of things. 
While I'm not ready to return to formal schooling, I have been accessing some of the moocs available onlie to saatisfy my curiosity about how things work in the computing world.
